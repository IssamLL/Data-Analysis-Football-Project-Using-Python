# Football Data Analysis Project Using Python

This project is a step-by-step guide to perform football analysis project using Python. In this project, I will explain to analyze football data, including data collection, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open Command Prompt `cmd` terminal
3. Type `python --version` to check python already install or not and version updated or not.
4. Check “Preferred Installer Program” `pip` to Type `pip --version`
5. Install Jupyterlab by running `pip install jupyterlab` in the cmd terminal.
6. Install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install jupyter notebook` in the cmd terminal.
7. After complete "Jupyter Notebook" downloading you will see path file location in the terminal, other pc terminal vary different path file location you can copy the path file location and paste the new line then hit enter, in my case path file is:  `C:\Users\ayans\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
8. Create folder in Desktop, in my case I have create folder in Desktop, here are example: [image]
9. After create the desktop folder then open folder and copy folder path location, in my case my folder path location is: `C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
10. When complete copy from folder path location then paste in the cmd terminal with `cd  C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
11. After paste folder path location then path will be change this type: [image]
12. Type `jupyter notebook` then hit enter. You can see open the browser new tab and display Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
13. When you see Jupyter Notebook Dashboard you can click with following option from above image

## Python Programming

1. Let's start with football data analysis using python.
2. Install the necessary packages by running `pip install pandas` , `pip install numpy` , `pip install matplotlib` , `pip install seaborn` in the cmd terminal.
3. 

## Data Visualization

Finally, we will visualize the data to make it more accessible and understandable. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs.

## Conclusion

This project provides a step-by-step guide to perform football analysis using Python. By following these steps, you will be able to collect, clean, manipulate, and visualize football data. Have fun exploring the world of football analytics!

## Thank you for watching this project.
