# Data Analysis Football Project Using Python

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to performing football analysis using Python. It covers data collection, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to gain insights into football data.

## Requirements

To successfully run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

To get started, follow these installation steps:
1. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open the Command Prompt terminal.
3. Type `python --version` to check if Python is already installed and if it is, verify that the version is up-to-date.
4. Verify the preferred installer program, `pip`, by typing `pip --version`.
5. Install Jupyterlab by running `pip install jupyterlab` in the Command Prompt terminal.
6. Install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install jupyter notebook` in the Command Prompt terminal.
7. Once Jupyter Notebook has finished downloading, you will see the file path location in the terminal. Copy this path file location and paste it on a new line, and then hit enter. In my case, the file path is:<br>
`C:\Users\ayans\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
8. Install the necessary packages by running `pip install pandas`, `pip install numpy`, `pip install matplotlib`, and `pip install seaborn` in the Command Prompt terminal.
9. Create a folder on your desktop for this project. For example:<br><br> ![Desktop Folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805087-43a0eab9-3563-4e95-a2d2-b49798e6376a.png)<br><br>
10. Once you have created the desktop folder, open the folder and copy the folder path location. In my case, the folder path location is: `C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
11. Paste the folder path location into the Command Prompt terminal by typing `cd C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
12. After pasting the folder path location, the path will change to:<br><br> ![JN- STEP 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805177-300bda0a-ef73-40cf-a17c-8167e8204684.png)<br><br>
13. Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter. You will see a new tab open in your browser displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
14. Click on the following options to get started, as shown in the image below:<br><br> ![JN- STEP 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805220-9d2bea58-36c6-45b7-986f-447243425ab1.png)<br><br>

## Python Programming
