# Football Data Analysis Project Using Python

This project is a step-by-step guide to perform football analysis project using Python. In this project, I will explain to analyze football data, including data collection, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install jupyter` in the terminal.
3. Install the necessary packages by running `pip install pandas` , `pip install numpy` , `pip install matplotlib` , `pip install seaborn` in the terminal.


## Step 1

- Open Command Prompt `cmd` terminal

## Step 2

- Type `python --version` to check python already install or not and version updated or not.
- Check “Preferred Installer Program” `pip` to Type `pip --version`

## Step 3

- To install Jupyterlab ``



## Data Collection

In this step, we will collect football data from the [Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/). You will need to sign up for a free API key, which will allow you to make up to 10,000 requests per day.

## Data Cleaning

Once we have collected the data, we need to clean it to ensure that it is usable for analysis. This includes removing duplicates, dealing with missing values, and converting data types.

## Data Manipulation

In this step, we will manipulate the data to extract useful insights. This includes calculating statistics, aggregating data, and merging datasets.

## Data Visualization

Finally, we will visualize the data to make it more accessible and understandable. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs.

## Conclusion

This project provides a step-by-step guide to perform football analysis using Python. By following these steps, you will be able to collect, clean, manipulate, and visualize football data. Have fun exploring the world of football analytics!
